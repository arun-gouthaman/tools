-Continue along loops
    Needs 2 or 3 edges selected
    .1st edge selected is the edge loop where the joint chain starts from
    .2nd edge shows the direction of the chain
    .3rd edge if selected is the edge loop where the chain ends, if not selected
        chain extends till last edge loop in sequence
